<h1>BASICS OF LIST</h1>
<h3>List:--> These are used to store the group of data in a single variable or used to store multiple items in a single variable with different data types</h3>
<body>
  1.upper():it is used to upper the given string or charectors.
           EXAMPLE:word=telugu 
           word=word.upper() ==>output is : TELUGU
  2.lower():it is used to lower the given string  or charectors.
           EXAMPLE : word=TELUGU
          word=word.lower() ==>output is :telugu
  3.count() : It is used to count the repeated charectors in a given string or word.
          EXAMPLE :name= TELUGU 
          print(name.count(U)) ==>output is : 2 ((here:-U repeated 2 times in a given name of the word))
  <h2>1.why Index start from zero</h2>
  4.After initialization of the string to variable that is stored on the memory.then the distance of the 
  word from the initialized variable in the memory block distance is starts from zero so index starts from the zero.so this scenario is called "offset distance."
  <h2>2.Difference between Array's and Lists</h2>
  5.Arrays are Homogineous Data Structures.
    HOMOGINEOUS:=>which is stores the same data type values (or) These are stored only one data type values (or) The stored data should be one type of data.
                EXAMPLES :==> A=[1,2,3,4] ----> it stores integer values only.
  6.Lists are stored Hetrogenious.
     HETROGINIOUS:==> Which is stores the different data type values (or) we can store any type of data like int,float,str etc in a single variable or in list.
                EXAMPLES :==> A=[1,2,3,"four",2.34,"six"]
  7.List functions: A.append() and B.pop()
               To add and remove the values from the list we can use this functions.append() is used for add the values into list..pop() is used for remove the values from the list.
  EXAMPLE :==> let taken L=[1,2,3,4]
               L.append(6) ==>output : L=[1,2,3,4,6] >>>here 6 is added to list.
  POP(): This function is used followed by the index position.if we given 2 .then remove the 2nd index position value.let's go through the above example.
               L.pop(1) :==>output : L=[1,3,4,6] >>> here 2 is removed from the list because of 1st index position of that charector.
  8.Types of Arrays :--> static and dynamic arrays.and differences in lists.
          Static Arrays :-->in this type of arrays we have to mentioned the length or how many values going to store in a array.and that much of values is stored and fixed legth.
                            which means we have to mentioned the values of the array before we stored.these are perform speed because of fixed lenght and static storage.
          Dynamic Arrays :-->In this type of arrays no need to declare the length or size array and type of the data.this is work in run time.dynamic arrays perform slow compare to
                             static arrays because of double their length in internally..let's go through with one example for better understanding.
                             EXAMPLE :==> if we have taken L=[1] so the length of the array is (1) that we can see. but internally array doubled lenght(2) and python allowcates the another memory location.
                             L=[1,2] then accupied space of 4 .L=[1,2,3] then accupied the space 6.it is going on like this in run time.that's why dynamic languaes are slow compare to static.
  NOTE:==> IN LIST INTERNALLY HAVE  1 SPACE BY DEFAULT.
